    "In this notebook, we load polling dataset from the 2020 USA presidential race and generate a choropleth map plot using the `altair` package in Python. We then use the WAYS package, to add meta-visualisation to the plots and interactive widgets. These features encourage the developer of the plot to question and evaluate the design choices made and the story being told, in advance of sharing their plot more widely."
